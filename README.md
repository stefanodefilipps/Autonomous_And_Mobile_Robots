implementation and analysis of two different methods to generate stable gait for biped walkers. The techniques implemented are the zero hybrid Dynamics and Tracking of a suitable CoM trajectory, generated by imposing initial condition which guarantees stability of the trajectory and tracked through kinematic inversion
